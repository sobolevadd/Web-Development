<h2>My work experience</h2>

    <li>Ballroom Dance Sport Coach
        <p> I was working as a Dance Coach when I was 14 years old for 3,5 years.
             I really loved this job, because thanks to that job 
             I learned how to work with people, how to work hard and combine 
             it with studying at school. It was a great experience</p>

            organizing ballroom dance sport competions and other things.
